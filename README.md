For parts 1-3 of the coursework, the marking will be a function of the number of successful tests as shown in the scoreboard and a series of hidden tests.

## Part 1-2
66% of the mark will be determined by the scoreboard tests.
You will get one point for each passing test and -1 for each failing test.
Then the mark is calculated by dividing the number of points achieved by the number of tests.

## Part 3
66% of the mark will be determined by the visible scoreboard tests and 33% will be determined by the hidden tests.
The mark will directly be proportial to the number of passed tests (no negative point).
So for instance, passing 7 out of 50 tests would result in a mark of 14/100.
